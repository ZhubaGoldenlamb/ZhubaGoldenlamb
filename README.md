Hi there 👋  
My name is Zhuba. I build GIS and remote sensing workflows that transform spatial data into reliable tools for analysis and decision-making. I have professional experience with the National Park Service, Los Angeles County, and NASA JPL, and I’m completing a Master’s in GIS focused on spatial data management, automation, and creating outputs for clients.

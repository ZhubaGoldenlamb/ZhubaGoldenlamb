Hi there 👋  
My name is Zhuba. I build GIS and remote sensing workflows that transform spatial data into reliable analysis and decision-support tools.

My work bridges **environmental systems, spatial modeling, and application development**. I have professional experience with the National Park Service, Los Angeles County, and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and I’m completing a Master’s in GIS focused on Python-based geospatial processing, spatial databases, and scalable data workflows.

# 🌿 Environmental Systems & Field Operations

Before transitioning fully into GIS, I led nursery operations and conducted large-scale botanical fieldwork at Joshua Tree National Park. This work informs how I approach spatial modeling — with ecological realism and operational awareness.

### Joshua Tree Nursery Operations & Botanical Field Systems

</a>

- Led propagation of **6,000 plants (20+ native species)** over 18 months  
- Installed greenhouse cooling infrastructure and irrigation systems  
- Supervised volunteers and conservation crews  
- Completed sediment control and structural improvement projects  
- QA/QC’d ~100,000 rows of botanical field data using dichotomous keys  

This repository documents the operational, infrastructure, and botanical systems that ground my GIS work in real-world environmental conditions.

A collection of interactive geospatial applications demonstrating:

- **Power BI dashboard development**
- **ArcGIS Experience Builder Web GIS**
- **Survey123 data integration**
- Cross-platform data validation and workflow design

This work focuses on application architecture, user interaction, and structured data workflows that support scalable municipal and organizational decision systems.

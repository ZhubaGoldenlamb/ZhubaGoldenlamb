Hi there 👋  
My name is Zhuba. I’m an environmental scientist specializing in remote sensing and currently completing my **Master’s in GIS (expected August 2026)**. I’ve worked with the National Park Service, Los Angeles County, and NASA JPL on projects supporting climate resilience and land management.

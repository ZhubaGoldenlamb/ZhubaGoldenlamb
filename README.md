Hi there 👋
My name is Zhuba. I’m an environmental scientist specializing in remote sensing and currently completing my master’s in GIS. I’ve worked with the National Park Service, Los Angeles County, and NASA JPL on projects supporting climate resilience and ecosystem management.

I’m currently working on:
• Fuel and fire ecology monitoring with Joshua Tree National Park
• Drone LiDAR analysis to detect invasive oak beetles for Los Angeles County Fire Department
• Post-fire water quality monitoring for NASA JPL

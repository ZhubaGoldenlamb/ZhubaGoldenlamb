Hi there 👋  
My name is Zhuba. I build GIS and remote sensing workflows that transform spatial data into reliable analysis and decision-support tools. I have professional experience with the National Park Service, Los Angeles County, and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and I’m completing a Master’s in GIS where I’m working with Python-based geospatial processing, spatial databases, and scalable data workflows.

#### **3. Geospatial Applications Development**

A collection of interactive geospatial applications demonstrating **Power BI dashboard development**, **ArcGIS Experience Builder Web GIS**, and **Survey123 data integration**. This project focuses on application design, data workflows, and user interaction rather than standalone analysis.

Key features include:
- Power BI dashboards integrating Yelp data with user-submitted Survey123 responses
- Rating-class dropdowns and cross-filtering across maps, charts, and summary cards
- Feature-level survey integration displayed in ArcGIS Experience Builder pop-ups
- Data cleaning and validation workflows to support reliable links and interactivity across platforms
